        <h2>Recipe</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by cutting your chicken breasts down the middle height.</li>
                <li>Taking your halved chicken breasts, place them in either a cut 
                    Zip-loc bag or some plastic wrap. Then, pound them out until they're
                    about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.
                </li>
                <li>Salt and pepper your cutlets.</li>
                <li>Prepare your breadcrumb mixture, using equal parts Panko and
                    regular breadcrumbs. Add the zest of your lemon and your freshly
                    grated parmesan. Mix well.
                </li>
                <li>Set out three containers for the breading process. Begin with your
                    flour, then the eggs, then your breadcrumb mixture.
                </li>
                <li>Place one chicken cutlet in the flour, coating thoroughly, then Place
                    it into your egg, coating thoroughly, and finally your breadcrumb mix,
                    coating thoroughly. Repeat for each chicken cutlet.
                </li>
                <li>Heat your oil on the stove, checking it's the right temperature using
                    some of your leftover breadcrumb mixture. Add your chicken cutlets to
                    the oil, taking care not to overcrowd them. This may take more than one
                    set. Bring your oil back up to temp in between cutlets.
                </li>
                <li>Serve with lemon wedges.</li>
            </ol>
