        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups plus 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus an additional
                1/2 cup for dusting
            </li>
            <li>5 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup leaf lard, chilled (I replace with regular lard, where
                do you even get leaf lard?)
            </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into very thin pats and
                chilled
            </li>
            <li>1 cup low-fat buttermilk, chilled</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 450F.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder,
                 baking soda, and salt. Working quickly (so the fats don't melt),
                 use your fingertips to rub the lard and butter into the dry mixture
                  until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the dry mixture and pour in the chilled
                 buttermilk. Stir with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to
                  come together. It will be very sticky. While it's still in the bowl,
                  fold the dough over on itself two times so that it picks up any
                  remaining flour, and then turn it out onto a lightly floured work
                   surface.</li>
              <li>Dust the top of the dough with flour and, with floured hands, gently
                  fold the dough over itself eight more times, turning one quarter
                  turn between each folding motion. Press dough into a 1-inch-thick
                  round. Cut out biscuits with a floured 2 1/2-inch cutter, being sure
                  to press straight down through the dough without twisting. Flour the
                  cutter between cuts.</li>
              <li>Center biscuits on a baking sheet, shoulder to shoulder, so that
                  they just touch. Reform scrap dough, working it as little as possible,
                  and continue cutting until you have 8 biscuits total.</li>
              <li>Bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees in the oven and continue
                  baking until tall and lightly gold on top, 8 to 12 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the biscuits to a bowl lined with a clean kitchen towel and
                fold towel over to preserve warmth and steam. Serve with butter and
                jam, or mustard and thin-cut ham, or sausage patties or just... eat
                them.</li>
        </ol>
